This is the code for "Probability Theory - The Math of Intelligence #6" By Siraj Raval on Youtube

## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/PrkiRVcrxOs) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of The Math of Intelligence course. I uses a Naive Bayes classifier to label some text as spam or not spam by training on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) Kaggle dataset as training data.

## Dependencies

* numpy
